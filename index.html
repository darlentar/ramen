<h1>What?</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rixed/ramen">Open source</a>, fast, non-distributed stream processing for monitoring.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>Thanks to such large companies as Google, Facebook, Linkedin and Netflix, the culture and practice of modern infrastructure monitoring has vastly improved and many good and free tools have been released publicly. Those tools understandably focus on large distributed infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ramen is designed for the scale most of us are dealing with.</p>

<p>Ramen has been designed to process network monitoring data in embedded appliances but can be useful in other contexts. If you need an all-purpose stream processor to turn inputs timeseries into dashboards or alerts but do not want to deploy Kubernetes in your three racks of hardware or have only a couple of GiB left of RAM for monitoring, then you might want to consider using Ramen.</p>

<h1>How?</h1>

<p>The key design principles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ramen is <em>not</em> based on a giant message queue; Instead messages are sent directly from producers to consumers, using memory-mapped ring-buffers (or, as a possible optimisation, direct function calls).</li>

<li>Operations are defined using a SQL-like language that's compiled down to machine code for efficiency, rather than requiring users to program in a procedural programming language.</li>

<p>This is how it looks like:</p>
<pre>
DEFINE memory_alert AS
  SELECT
    time, host,
    free + used + cached + buffered + slab AS total
  FROM memory
  GROUP BY host
  NOTIFY "Low RAM" WITH PARAMETERS host, free, total WHEN free / total < 0.5
</pre>

<li>An HTTP daemon mimics the <a href="https://graphite-api.readthedocs.io/">Graphite API</a> so it works with <a href="https://grafana.com">Grafana</a> out of the box.</li>

<li>Past data can be archived and retrieved by new queries, so that Ramen is not only useful for dashboarding and alerting but also for troubleshooting/capacity planning/...</li>
</ul>
