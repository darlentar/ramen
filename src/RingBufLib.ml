(* Note regarding nullmask and constructed types:
 * For list, we cannot know in advance the number of values so the nullmask
 * size can not be known in advance.
 * For Vec and Tuples, when given only the value we cannot retrieve the
 * type in depth, so we cannot serialize a value without being given the
 * full type.
 * For all these reasons, structured types will be serialized with their
 * own nullmask as a prefix. And we will consider all values are nullable
 * so we do not have to pass the types in practice. That's not a big waste
 * of space considering how rare it is that we want to serialize a
 * constructed type. Maybe we should do the same for the whole output
 * tuple BTW. *)
