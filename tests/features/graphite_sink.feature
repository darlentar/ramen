Feature: Test Ramen Graphite data sink

  Background:
    Given ramen must be in the path
    And the environment variable RAMEN_PATH is not defined
    And a file test.ramen with content
      """
      define graphite as listen for graphite;
      """
    And test.ramen is compiled
    And ramen supervisor is started
    And program test is running
    And I wait 3 seconds

  Scenario: Graphite metric should be decoded properly and visible in tail
    # Annoying: here we have to trick the worker into archiving:
    When I run ramen with arguments tail test/graphite -n 0
    And I wait 1 second
    And I run echo with arguments 'foo.bar;cpu=0;host=glop 42 1545202428' | socat -t 0 STDIN UDP:127.0.0.1:2003
    And I run ramen with arguments tail -l 1 test/graphite
    Then ramen must print 1 line on stdout
    And ramen must mention "foo.bar"
    And ramen must mention "("cpu";"0")"
    And ramen must mention "("host";"glop")"
    And ramen must mention "42"
    And ramen must mention "1545202428"
    And ramen must exit gracefully.
