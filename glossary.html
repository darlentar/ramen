<h1>Glossary</h1>

<a name="AggregationFunction"><h2>Aggregation Function</h2></a>
  A function that build a result value out of several input values.
  The result is finalized and output when some given condition is met
  (see xref:Commit[]).

<a name="Clause"><h2>Clause</h2></a>
  Part of an xref:Operation[operation]. Especially, the aggregate operation
  has a `select` clause, a `where` clause, a `group-by` clause, etc...

<a name="Commit"><h2>Commit</h2></a>
  When several incoming xref:Tuple[tuples] are aggregated into a single
  xref:Group[group], a condition must be specified that, when met, will trigger
  the output of the aggregated value. This is called to _commit_ the group.
  What happens to that group after the result tuple has been output depends on
  the flush clause; By default it will merely be reset (tumbling windows),
  but it is also possible to resume the aggregation from where it was or to
  expels oldest events (sliding window) or even other behaviors.

<a name="Event"><h2>Event</h2></a>
  An individual message to be processed. In Ramen events are
  xref:Tuples[tuples]. `Event`, `message` and `tuple` are used
  interchangeably.

<a name="FQName"><h2>Fully Qualified Name</h2></a>
  The fully qualified name of an xref:Operation[operation] is the name of the
  xref:Program[program] it belongs to, followed by a slash ("/"), followed by
  the operation name. Those FQ names are globally unique.

<a name="Group"><h2>Group</h2></a>
  Within the context of an operation, a `group` refers to an aggregation group,
  ie. the set of tuples sharing the same key and aggregated together. This
  group lives (in RAM) until it is committed, when it can be deleted or
  downsized before resuming the operation. Aggregation groups are therefore
  closely related to the concept of xref:Windowing[windows].

<a name="Notification"><h2>Notification</h2></a>
  In addition to tuples, workers also output so called `notifications` using
  the `notify` clause. Those follow a particular format and are not intended
  for other workers but for the notifier process, that may eventually send an
  alert to users.

<a name="Nullable"><h2>Nullable</h2></a>
  Said of a tuple field that can hold the NULL value. Most fields should not be
  nullable as it implies expensive runtime checks.

<a name="Operation"><h2>Operation</h2></a>
  An operation is a statement in the SQL-inspired specific language,
  describing how to produce some output from some inputs. Operation have names
  that must be unique within a xref:Program[program].  Every operation has an
  input and an output type, which is the types of the tuples they consume and
  produce. Operations can receive tuples from any other operations of the same
  program or from any operations of any other program already compiled.

<a name="Program"><h2>Program</h2></a>
  Containing one or several xref:Operation[operations]. This is the smallest
  subset of the configuration that can be edited/compiled/started/stopped.
  Inside a program functions are allowed to form cycles.  In addition to a set
  of operations, a program also has a name. Those names must be globally
  unique.

<a name="RingBuffer"><h2>Ring-Buffer</h2></a>
  Fixed sized FIFO buffer used by workers to exchange tuples.

<a name="StatefulFunction"><h2>Stateful function</h2></a>
  A function that requires an internal state in order to output a result.
  xref:AggregationFunction[Aggregation functions] are a special case of
  stateful functions.

<a name="StatelessFunction"><h2>Stateless function</h2></a>
  A function that requires nothing more than its parameters to compute its
  result. For instance, all arithmetic functions are stateless.

<a name="StreamProcessor"><h2>Stream Processor</h2></a>
  A software which purpose is to perform user defined computations on a
  theoretically infinite stream of data.
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream_management_system.

<a name="Timeseries"><h2>Timeseries</h2></a>
  A time series is a series of values indexed by time. Timeseries can be
  extracted from Ramen if additional information about event times are
  provided.
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series.

<a name="Tuple"><h2>Tuple</h2></a>
  What is consumed and produced by functions.  A set of values, each of its
  own type. Those values are called "fields" and beside its type a field also
  has a name that must be unique in the tuple.
  For instance, +{ "name": "John Dae"; "age": 42; "is_male": true }+ is a
  tuple with 3 fields (here represented in JSON for convenience).

<a name="Windowing"><h2>Windowing</h2></a>
  In a xref:StreamProcessor[stream processor], _windowing_ refers to how
  incoming events are batched for aggregation. Usually windows are either
  sliding or tumbling, with variations (see for instance
  https://i.stack.imgur.com/mm06A.jpg[this picture]). Ramen is rather unique
  in this regard that it has no notion of a window, especially not one bound
  to time, since it has no preconception of time. Instead, Ramen has explicit
  conditions for when to stop an aggregation (to xref:Commit[commit] the
  group), and what to keep from one aggregation to the next. This makes it
  possible to implement many windowing behavior, including tumbling and
  sliding windows.

<a name="Worker"><h2>Worker</h2></a>
  One of the possibly many executables generated and run by Ramen to carry out
  some operation on the data stream.
